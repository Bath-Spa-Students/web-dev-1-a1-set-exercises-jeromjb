        <h1>Wreck It Ralph</h1>
        <img src="wirmov.jpg" alt="Wreck It Ralph Poster">
        <p>The 2012 animated comedy Wreck-It Ralph was made in the United States by Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee wrote the screenplay, and Moore, Johnston, and Jim Reardon wrote the story. Rich Moore, making his feature directing debut, produced the film. The movie's executive producer was John Lasseter. The movie, which stars Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, Sarah Silverman, and John C. Reilly as the title villain in an arcade game, follows his journey from being a "bad guy" to becoming a hero.</p>
        <h2 id="Plot"> Plot:</h2>
        <p>The video game characters exit their virtual worlds when Litwak's Arcade shuts and interact with one another through a power strip known as Game Central Station. The antagonist of the platform game Fix-it Felix, Jr., Wreck-It Ralph, pays a visit to Bad-Anon, a support group for villains, one evening to vent his resentment about his given job. After being turned away from his game's 30-year celebration, Ralph resolves to win a medal because he thinks he will be acknowledged for it. After learning that the first-person shooter Hero's Duty gives out medals, Ralph enters the game covertly and, once he gets past the Cy-Bugs, an insectoid monster type of monster, takes a medal.</p>
        <p>Sugar Rush is a candy-themed kart racing game where Ralph unintentionally launches himself into an escape spacecraft carrying a Cy-Bug and crashes. His game is deemed "out of order" and in danger of being disconnected now that Ralph is gone. Resolve it Felix Jr. himself exits the game in search of Ralph, forming an alliance with Hero's Duty's heroine, Sergeant Calhoun. When Cy-Bugs are not in their game, they act like a virus, which is why Calhoun tracks them. Felix fears Ralph may suffer the same fate as Turbo, the main character of the racing game TurboTime, who attempted to take control of a recently installed RoadBlasters cabinet out of jealousy, which resulted to the unplugging of both games.</p>
        <p>Vanellope von Schweetz, a racer in Sugar Rush, uses her stolen medal to gain entry into the evening race that decides which characters can be played the following day. Sugar Rush's world's king, King Candy, prevents her from racing since she is a bug that teleports randomly. Ralph helps Vanellope build a new kart and teaches her how to drive inside Diet Cola Mountain with the understanding that if she wins, she will get the medal back. When Felix and Calhoun arrive in Sugar Rush, they get into "Nesquik-sand," cooperate to get out, and start to fall in love.</p>
        <p>Ralph receives the medal back from King Candy after he breaks into Sugar Rush's source code. He asserts that if Vanellope is made playable, her glitching will cause Sugar Rush to be declared malfunctioning and disconnected, and Vanellope would perish because she is unable to exit the game because she is a glitch. After deciding he couldn't let Vanellope race, Ralph wrecks her kart. In the meantime, Felix accidentally reminds Calhoun about her late fianc√©, who was slain by a Cy-Bug before their wedding, and Calhoun leaves Felix. As Calhoun finds out that the Cy-Bug has expanded exponentially, Felix is put in jail by Sour Bill, King Candy's assistant.</p>
        <p>When Ralph, who is dejected, goes back to Fix-it Felix, Jr., the game has been evacuated. Ralph discovers that Vanellope is playable in the Sugar Rush cabinet when he tosses the medal onto the screen. After discovering King Candy had lied, Ralph goes back to Sugar Rush and questions Sour Bill. He learns that King Candy had harmed Vanellope's code. Vanellope's exact role is unknown to everybody but King Candy thanks to his programming changes. But, the game will reset itself and all of King Candy's modifications will be lost if Vanellope wins a race. Vanellope and Felix are released from jail by Ralph. Vanellope's kart is fixed by Felix. The Cy-Bugs appear and begin ruining the game just as Vanellope enters the race after the fact.</p>
        <p>King Candy tries to run Vanellope off the track, unaware of the Cy-Bugs, which causes them both to glitch. King Candy is revealed as Turbo by glitching. Turbo assumed control of Sugar Rush covertly when TurboTime was unplugged. Vanellope runs away as a Cy-Bug eats Turbo, combining with him to create an insectoid monstrosity. Vanellope is stuck in their games, unable to escape the faults.Remembering from Hero's Duty that a beacon will attract and eliminate the Cy-Bugs, Ralph fights Turbo and brings down Diet Cola Mountain's Mentos roof, causing a bright eruption that attracts and eliminates both Turbo and the Cy-Bugs. After saving Ralph, Vanellope reaches the finish line. She maintains her glitching ability, viewing it as a benefit, even after the game resets to expose her as Sugar Rush's real ruler.</p>
        <p>Satisfied with his villainous role and at last receiving respect from his fellow characters, Ralph goes back to playing his game. Ralph witnesses Vanellope grow to be Sugar Rush's favorite character while Felix and Calhoun tie the knot.</p>
